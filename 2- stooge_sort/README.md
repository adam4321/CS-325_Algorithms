Description:    README for Homework 2 programs


-stoogesort is a program that takes in a text file of values with each line
representing and array of values. The first value is the array size for the 
remaining elements. The program takes in the values, sorts them, and then 
outputs the values to stooge.txt.

-stoogeTime is a program that runs the stoogesort algorithm by filling a 
deque with random integers between 1-10,000 and outputs the algorithm to
the console for array sizes between 150 and 1,500.

-To compile the programs on Linux, just unzip the folder and then type "make"
into the command line from within the directory. The makefile will compile 
the two programs into the 2 final executables.

-To run the programs, just type the name into the commannd line from within
the directory that they are in. The 2 programs are:

- stoogesort
- stoogeTime
